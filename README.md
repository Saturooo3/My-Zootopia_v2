# My Awesome Project

The purpose of this project is to create a website, which shows information from a choosen animal.

## Installation

First of all install the needed packages over >pip install -r requirements.txt<

First it loads the data over the connected api. After that the information is used to be implemented in
a html template.
Lastly a web page with the created html is going to be created.

## Usage

To use the project run >python animals_web_generator.py<. Enter the name of the animal of your wish.
Voilat! A web page with some information about the animal has been created. 

## Contributing

In the module data_fetcher, there could be added more information to be shown. It just needs a couple more lines in
the function "serialize_data".
